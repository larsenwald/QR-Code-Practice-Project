## My process

First I took the design into photoshop in order to use the ruler tool to measure the height and width of the card as well as the elements within it. Once I got those, I started using the eye-dropper tool to fetch the colors, but then I realized that the colors are provided for you in the style-guide.md file.
Then it was just a matter of creating a card div, a div for the qr code, and a div for the card text with its own nested elements. Afterwards, I styled it with CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I need to learn how to measure border-radius and the space between elements with text. Currently, I just sort of try to duplicate them by eye and it's kind of annoying that this is more of an art than a science. I wish I knew about a sure-fire way to get those measurements.
